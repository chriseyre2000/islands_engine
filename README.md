# IslandsEngine

This is the sample application from Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP and Phoenix (Beta 6).

It's a variant of battleships - you try to forest the opponents islands.

I have deviated from the text code since I prefer to avoid one line functions.
Also I have added some unit tests
